# Simple File Split Guide - Zero Functionality Changes

## Current Status
Your code works perfectly with the single file approach. The error you're seeing is from the original code logic, not from any file splitting.

## Super Simple Split Approach

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (Recommended)
1. Keep using your current single file
2. When you have time, manually split using any text editor:
   - Copy lines 1-1000 → `visual-search-part1.js`
   - Copy lines 1001-2000 → `visual-search-part2.js` 
   - Copy lines 2001-3000 → `visual-search-part3.js`
   - Copy lines 3001-4000 → `visual-search-part4.js`
   - Copy lines 4001-end → `visual-search-part5.js`

3. Update Liquid templates to load all 5 files:
```liquid
<script src="{{ 'visual-search-part1.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
<script src="{{ 'visual-search-part2.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
<script src="{{ 'visual-search-part3.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
<script src="{{ 'visual-search-part4.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
<script src="{{ 'visual-search-part5.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
```

### Option 2: Keep Current Single File
Your current setup works perfectly! The file splitting is just for organization - it doesn't fix the API error you're seeing.

## About the Error
The `Failed to fetch` error is from your API endpoint configuration, not from file splitting. This would happen regardless of whether you use 1 file or 5 files.

## Recommendation
Keep your current working setup until you have time to manually split the files yourself. File splitting is purely for organization and doesn't affect functionality.
