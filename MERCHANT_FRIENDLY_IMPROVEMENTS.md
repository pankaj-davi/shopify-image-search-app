### 2. **Add Visual Previews**
- Screenshot of theme editor with visual search being added
- Before/after images showing visual search in action
- Preview of customization options

### 3. **Outcome-Focused Benefits**
**Current:** "Better Performance - No script injection needed"
**Better:** "Faster loading times - Your store loads quicker for customers"

## 🎨 Enhanced App Block Schema

### Current Schema Issues:
- Too many technical terms
